## Abstract & Introduction Claims

| Paper Claim | Implementation Status | Evidence | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Compound corruptions: noise, missingness, bias/drift | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | `recon.py`: Eq. 1 decomposition | None |
| Tri-latent encoder separates Z_S, Z_N, Z_B | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | `rcgnn.py` lines 8-46 | None |
| Structure-level invariance across regimes | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | `invariance.py` + integrated in `train_rcgnn.py` | None |
| Target: 60% variance reduction | ⚠️ CODED, NOT TESTED | Code ready; metrics exist | No validation experiment |
| Maintain SHD under corruption | ⚠️ CODED, NOT TESTED | Training runs; no benchmark | No corruption test |

---

## Problem Formulation (Section 3)

### Definition 1: Compound Corruption Process
```
Paper: X(t) = B^(e) ⊙ S(t) + b^(e) + ε^(e)(t)
Code:  src/models/recon.py line ~80-83
✅ MATCH: All three components modeled
```

### Assumption 1: Partial Invariance
```
Paper: G* and mechanisms invariant; corruption patterns vary
Code:  Enforced via structure-level invariance loss
✅ MATCH: IRMStructureInvariance implements this
```

### Learning Objective
```
Paper: min SHD + λ·Var[A^(e)]
Code:  compute_total_loss() in optim.py
✅ MATCH: Both terms in total loss
```

## RC-GNN Framework (Section 4)

### 4.1 Tri-Latent Encoding

**Paper Requirements** (Eq. 3-5):
```
Z_S = E_S(Imputer(X, M), e)      # Signal  
Z_N = E_N(Imputer(X, M), e)      # Noise context
Z_B = E_B(X̄_e, e)                # Bias/drift
```

**Implementation Status**:

| Component | Paper | Code | Status | Gap |
|-----------|-------|------|--------|-----|
| Signal encoder E_S | ✅ | `rcgnn.py:13-17` | ✅ | None |
| Noise encoder E_N | ✅ | `rcgnn.py:19-23` | ✅ | None |
| Bias encoder E_B | ✅ | `rcgnn.py:25-29` | ✅ | None |
| **Imputer(X,M)** | ✅ GRU-D spec | Partial | ⚠️ | **No masking-aware imputation; no uncertainty** |
| Environment index e | ✅ | `config: n_envs` | ✅ | None |

**Gap Details**: Paper specifies "Masking-aware imputer (GRU-D or Transformer)" but code skips this step:
```python
# Current (WRONG):
z_s = E_S(x)  # x is raw, possibly with NaN

# Should be:
x_imputed, uncertainty = Imputer(x, M)
z_s = E_S(x_imputed)  # Clean input
```

**Impact**: Not critical for initial training, but reduces missingness handling fidelity.

### 4.2 Causal Structure Learning

**Paper Requirements** (Eq. 6-7):
```
A = σ(GNN_A(φ(Z_S)))                    # Adjacency
ĥ(A) = trace(exp(A⊙A)) - d = 0        # Acyclicity
Ŝ_j(t) = g_j(Σ_k A_kj ψ_{k→j}(Z_{S,k}))  # Mechanisms
```

| Requirement | Paper | Code | Status | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Adjacency via GNN | ✅ | `structure.py` | ✅ | None |
| Acyclicity penalty | ✅ | `optim.py:42-79` | ✅ | None |
| Per-node mechanisms g_j | ✅ | `mechanisms.py` | ✅ | None |
| **Edge functions ψ_k→j** | ✅ Edge-specific | Shared weights | ⚠️ | **Using shared MLP for all edges, not edge-specific** |

**Gap Details**: Paper specifies edge-specific transformation networks but code likely uses shared parameters:
```python
# Current (ACCEPTABLE):
ψ = MLP()  # Single network for all edges
for k, j:
    h = ψ(Z_S_k)

# Should be (for full fidelity):
ψ = {(k,j): MLP_kj() for k,j}  # d×d networks
for k, j:
    h = ψ[k,j](Z_S_k)
```

**Impact**: Reduces model expressiveness but not critical; training still works.

### 4.3 Corruption-Aware Reconstruction

**Paper Equation** (Eq. 8):
```
X̂(t) = B̂^(e)(Z_B)⊙Ŝ(t) + b̂^(e)(Z_B) + η(Z_N, e)
```

| Component | Paper | Code | Status | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Multiplicative bias B̂^(e) | ✅ | `recon.py` | ✅ | None |
| Additive bias b̂^(e) | ✅ | `recon.py` | ✅ | None |
| Noise generation η | ✅ | `recon.py` | ✅ | None |
| Signal reconstruction Ŝ | ✅ | `rcgnn.py` | ✅ | None |

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Training Objective (Section 5)

**Paper Equation** (Eq. 9):
```
L(θ) = L_recon + λ_acy·h(A) + λ_inv·L_inv + λ_dis·L_disent + λ_sparse·‖A‖₁ + λ_mech·L_mech
```

| Loss Term | Paper | Code | Status | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| L_recon | ✅ Eq. 10 | `optim.py:92` | ✅ | None |
| λ_acy·h(A) | ✅ | `optim.py:42` | ✅ | None |
| λ_inv·L_inv | ✅ Eq. 11-12 | `invariance.py` + train loop | ✅ | None |
| λ_dis·L_disent | ✅ Eq. 13 | `optim.py:115` | ✅ | None (uses correlation, not HSIC/MINE) |
| λ_sparse·‖A‖₁ | ✅ | `optim.py:24` | ✅ | None |
| **λ_mech·L_mech** | ✅ Specified | Not found | ❌ | **MISSING: Mechanism fitting loss** |

**Gap Details**: Paper specifies mechanism fitting loss but not implemented:
```python
# Missing:
L_mech = MSE(S_true, S_predicted)
L_total += lambda_mech * L_mech
```

**Impact**: Can train without it (reconstruction acts as proxy), but paper requires it.

### 5.1 Structure-Level Invariance

**Paper Specifies** (Eq. 11-12):
```
L_inv^var = Var_{e∈E}[A^(e)]        # Variance penalty
L_inv^IRM = Σ_e ‖∇_ω R_e(ω⊙A^(e))‖²  # IRM-inspired
```

| Approach | Paper | Code | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Variance penalty | ✅ | `invariance.py` | ✅ |
| IRM penalty | ✅ | `invariance.py` | ✅ |
| Multi-environment support | ✅ | config: `n_envs` | ✅ |

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

---

### 5.2 Disentanglement Loss

**Paper Specifies** (Eq. 13):
```
L_disent = HSIC(Z_S, Z_N) + HSIC(Z_S, Z_B) + MINE(Z_N, Z_B)
```

| Metric | Paper | Code | Status | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| HSIC | ✅ Specified | Correlation used | ⚠️ | Simpler metric; works but not full fidelity |
| MINE | ✅ Specified | Correlation used | ⚠️ | Simpler metric; works but not full fidelity |

**Status**: ✅ ACCEPTABLE (correlation is weaker but functional)
