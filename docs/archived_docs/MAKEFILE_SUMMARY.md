## Quick Start for Busy People

### **Copy & Paste (2 minutes)**

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd "/home/adetayo/Documents/CSCI Forms/Adetayo Research/Robust Causal Graph Neural Networks under Compound Sensor Corruptions/rcgnn"

# Run this one line:
make setup && conda activate rcgnn-env && make full-pipeline && make results
```

**Done.** Model is trained, results are displayed.

## The Makefile Covers Everything

### **Starting from Scratch**

```bash
make setup              # Install everything (conda + packages + data)
conda activate rcgnn-env # Activate environment
make full-pipeline      # Train + analyze + compare
make results            # View results
```

### **Day-to-Day Usage**

```bash
conda activate rcgnn-env # One time per session
make train              # Train model (60 seconds)
make results            # View results
make view-artifacts     # See generated files
```

### **Analysis & Comparison**

```bash
make analyze            # Threshold optimization (2 sec)
make baseline           # Compare methods (3 sec)
make full-pipeline      # Everything together (70 sec)
```

### **Cleanup & Reset**

```bash
make clean              # Delete artifacts (keep code)
make clean-all          # Delete everything (need setup again)
```

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Remember to activate conda environment:**
```bash
conda activate rcgnn-env
```

💾 **Results are saved in:**
```
artifacts/
├── checkpoints/        (trained model)
├── adjacency/          (learned structure)
├── *_report.txt        (analysis reports)
├── *.png               (visualizations)
└── *.json              (metrics)
```

🔄 **Each command is independent:**
```bash
make train              # works standalone
make analyze            # works standalone
make baseline           # works standalone
```

🆘 **If stuck, try:**
```bash
make help                  # Show all commands
make check-env             # Verify setup
make info                  # Show project info
```
