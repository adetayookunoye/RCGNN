## ‚è∞ 60-Hour Implementation Plan

### Week 1 (Oct 29 - Nov 2): Infrastructure
```
Mon: Stability metrics             (2-4 hours) ‚Üê START HERE
Tue: Synthetic corruption bench    (6-8 hours)
Wed: GRU-D imputer                 (8-12 hours, optional)
```
**Output**: Ready for hypothesis testing

### Week 2 (Nov 3-8): Theory Validation
```
Identifiability test   (6-8 hours)
Stability bound test   (4-6 hours)
```
**Output**: Propositions empirically verified

### Week 3 (Nov 8-13): Hypothesis Testing
```
H1: Structural accuracy    (8-10 hours)
H2: Stability improvement  (6-8 hours)
H3: Expert agreement       (4-8 hours)
```
**Output**: Main paper results

### Week 4 (Nov 13-22): Results & Paper
```
Baseline comparisons   (4-6 hours)
Ablation studies       (3-4 hours)
Results writing        (8-10 hours)
```
**Output**: Publication-ready paper

## üéØ Critical Next Steps (This Week)

### By Friday (Oct 31)
- [ ] Read: `IMPLEMENTATION_PRIORITIES.md`
- [ ] Code: Stability metrics (4 hours)
- [ ] Plan: Synthetic corruption parameters

### By Monday (Nov 4)
- [ ] Implement: Stability metrics tested
- [ ] Start: Synthetic benchmark generation

---

## üìä What's Complete vs Missing

### ‚úÖ Ready to Use (No Work Needed)
- Tri-latent encoders (Z_S, Z_N, Z_B)
- Structure learning with acyclicity
- Reconstruction with corruption modeling
- All 6 loss components
- Training loop (100+ epochs validated)
- Standard metrics (SHD, F1)
- Config system
- Code quality & documentation

### üî¥ CRITICAL (Must Have for Publication)
- **Stability metrics** (adjacency_variance, jaccard, policy_consistency)
- **Synthetic corruption benchmarks** (multi-environment, 40-60% missingness)
- **H1/H2/H3 experiments** (hypothesis validation)
- **Baseline comparisons** (NOTEARS, DCDI, DECI vs RC-GNN)

### üü° Nice-to-Have (Can Skip if Time Tight)
- GRU-D masking-aware imputer (current basic version works)
- Edge-specific transformation networks (shared weights acceptable)
- HSIC/MINE metrics (correlation acceptable)

## üí° Key Insight

Your implementation is **SOLID**‚Äîall core components built and wired.  
What's **MISSING** is **VALIDATION**‚Äîprove the 3 hypotheses work.  
This 60-hour push **SYSTEMATICALLY** validates everything.

**No fundamental design challenges remain‚Äîjust execution.**

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Can I skip anything?**  
A: GRU-D imputer and edge-specific networks are optional. Everything else is critical for publication.

**Q: How much time do I realistically have?**  
A: ~60 hours over 4 weeks. Start immediately for Nov 22 deadline.

**Q: What if something breaks?**  
A: See IMPLEMENTATION_PRIORITIES.md for risk mitigation strategies. Most tasks have fallback options.

**Q: Should I implement everything in Priority 1 or just start with 1.1?**  
A: Start with 1.1 (stability metrics) for quick win. Parallelize 1.2-1.3 while that's testing.

**Q: Which documents should I share with my advisor/co-authors?**  
A: Start with STATUS_REPORT.md (5 min read). Then NEXT_STEPS_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md.

## üöÄ Ready?

1. Open `IMPLEMENTATION_PRIORITIES.md`
2. Find Priority 1.1: "Add Stability Metrics"
3. **Start Monday morning with a 4-hour sprint**
4. By Tuesday, you'll have your first measurable progress

**You've got this. üí™**
