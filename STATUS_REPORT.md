# 📊 RC-GNN: Status Report & Path to Publication

**Generated**: October 27, 2025, 11:00 PM  
**Status**: ✅ **75% COMPLETE** | 🚀 **READY FOR NEXT PHASE**

---

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**Your RC-GNN implementation is at the "integrated but unvalidated" stage.**

- ✅ **All core components built and connected**: Tri-latent encoders, structure learning, invariance loss, reconstruction
- ✅ **Training loop running successfully**: 100+ epochs on UCI Air without crashes  
- ✅ **Loss components computing**: All 6 losses implemented and backpropagating
- ⚠️ **NOT YET validated**: No hypothesis tests (H1/H2/H3) run; baselines not compared
- ⚠️ **Paper claims unsubstantiated**: Propositions not empirically verified; stability metrics not computed

**Next 14-18 days**: Execute hypothesis tests → Validate paper claims → Write results → **PUBLICATION READY**

## 🚨 Critical Gaps (Blocking Publication)

### 1. **Missing Stability Metrics** 🔴 HIGHEST PRIORITY
- **Why Critical**: Paper's core innovation is structure-level invariance; can't validate without measuring variance
- **Impact**: Can't run H2 experiment; can't prove stability improvement
- **Effort**: 2-4 hours
- **Location**: `src/training/metrics.py`
- **Required**: 
  - `adjacency_variance(A_dict_by_env)`
  - `edge_set_jaccard(E_dict_by_env)`
  - `policy_consistency(A_dict_by_env, policy_edges)`

### 2. **No Synthetic Corruption Benchmarks** 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY
- **Why Critical**: Can't run H1 experiment without multi-environment corrupted data
- **Impact**: Can't prove structural accuracy claim
- **Effort**: 6-8 hours
- **Location**: Extend `scripts/synth_bench.py`
- **Required**: 
  - Multi-environment generation (4-5 regimes)
  - Tunable MCAR/MAR/MNAR (40-60% missingness)
  - Known ground truth adjacency

### 3. **No Hypothesis Tests** 🔴 CRITICAL
- **Why Critical**: Paper makes 3 specific claims (H1/H2/H3); ALL unvalidated
- **Impact**: Can't submit paper without experimental evidence
- **Effort**: 20 hours
- **Required**: Scripts for each hypothesis

### 4. **No Baseline Comparisons** 🔴 CRITICAL
- **Why Critical**: Reviewers will demand comparison to NOTEARS/DCDI/DECI
- **Impact**: No evidence RC-GNN is better
- **Effort**: 6 hours (runner script already exists)
- **Required**: Unified evaluation on all datasets

### 5. **GRU-D Imputer Incomplete** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY
- **Why Important**: Paper specifies masking-aware imputation; current implementation incomplete
- **Impact**: Doesn't handle MNAR optimally; missing uncertainty estimates
- **Effort**: 8-12 hours
- **Can Defer**: Can do after experiments if time tight

## ✅ What's Working Well

1. **Core Training Loop**: 100+ epoch runs without crashing ✅
2. **Loss Computation**: All 6 components computing and backpropagating ✅
3. **Data Loading**: UCI Air, synthetic data loading correctly ✅
4. **Checkpointing**: Best model saved to `artifacts/checkpoints/` ✅
5. **Gradient Flow**: No NaN/Inf issues observed ✅
6. **Multi-environment Support**: Config supports n_envs parameter ✅
7. **Code Quality**: Clean architecture, good separation of concerns ✅

## 💬 Key Questions for You

Before diving in, clarify:

1. **Timeline**: Must this be done by specific date? (affects prioritization)
2. **Expert Access**: Have you identified air quality expert for H3, or proceed with literature?
3. **Baseline Priority**: Must compare all 5 methods or focus on top 3?
4. **GRU-D**: Full implementation or simplified time-aware imputation?
5. **Compute**: GPU available or CPU-only deployment?
6. **Venue**: Target conference (deadline?) or journal?

## 🚀 Final Thought

Your implementation is **solid and well-integrated.** The remaining work is **systematic validation** of the 3 core hypotheses. None of the next steps are fundamentally hard—they're mainly:
1. **Measurement** (implement metrics)
2. **Data generation** (synthetic benchmarks)
3. **Experimentation** (run and compare)
4. **Documentation** (write results)

**You have everything you need to complete this in 2-3 weeks.** 

Start with stability metrics tomorrow morning. 🎯
