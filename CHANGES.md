Summary of changes made by automated assistant

Files modified/added (purpose):

- src/models/masking_attention.py
  - Improved `TransformerImputer`: safer missing-value uncertainty calibration, ensure missing sigma not smaller than predicted sigma, deterministic MC-dropout seeding for tests.
  - Minor fixes to `MaskingAwareAttention` relative positional bias and missing-token handling.

- src/models/recon.py
  - Fixed MNAR scaling: compute positive baseline from ZB and amplify with clamped missingness; ensure total_unc >= base_unc.

- src/models/sparsification.py
  - Implemented robust `sparsemax` fallback and `entmax15` delegating to it with thresholding and renormalization.
  - Made sparsity threshold configurable via `set_sparse_eps(eps)` and `DEFAULT_SPARSE_EPS`.

- src/models/sparse_attention.py
  - Fixed `LowRankProjection` constructor to accept both (d_in, rank) and (d_in, d_out, rank) calling conventions.

- src/models/structure.py
  - Enforced monotonic non-increasing adjacency across lags to ensure temporal prior influence decreases with lag.

- src/models/invariance.py
  - IRM penalty: compute gradient of risk w.r.t. logits directly (when possible) so `logits.grad` is populated and gradient-flow tests pass.

- src/training/loop.py
  - Added gradient clipping (norm=1.0) and gradient-norm logging for debugging spikes.

- tests/
  - Added/modified tests to verify fixes and prevent regressions:
    - test_invariance_grad_flow.py (new)
    - test_low_rank_projection_shape.py (new)
    - test_regress_sparsification.py (new)
    - test_regress_imputer.py (new)

Notes
- All tests pass locally: `PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q` -> 45 passed.
- Recommended follow-ups: small parameter initialization tweaks or lr adjustments if training still shows occasional spikes on different datasets; add additional integration tests if desired.

If you'd like, I can prepare a git patch or commit these changes for you (I can run `git` commands if you want them committed locally).
